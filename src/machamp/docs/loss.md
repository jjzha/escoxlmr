### Task-specific parameters

[back to main README](../README.md)

You can set the metric and the loss weight per task. The loss weight is mostly
useful in a multi-task setting, when some tasks should get less priority while
updating the parameters (because it is less important, easier, or because it
has more training data). It can be set as follows:

```
{
    "UD-EWT": {
        "train_data_path": "data/ewt.train",
        "dev_data_path": "data/ewt.dev",
        "word_idx": 1,
        "tasks": {
            "upos": {
                "task_type": "string2string",
                "column_idx": 2,
                "loss_weight": .5,
            },
            "dependency": {
                "task_type": "dependency",
                "column_idx": 6
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The default `loss_weight` is defined in `configs/params.json`, and is `1.0`, meaning that in the example above
the `dependency` task has twice as much importance as `upos` for the loss.
